EDGE CASES TO KEEP IN MIND FOR VARIOUS PROBLEM TYPES


matrix problems
- be cautious of the counter-intuitive matrix direction (top left is matrix[0][0] and indices increase going down the matrix)
- be cautious of single-cell matrices

general:
- careful checking for Nonetypes in if statemenets if values can also be zero

binary and bitwise:
- binary nums digit zero is on the right so careful when comparingbinary nums, num1[i] != num2[i] but num1[-i] == num2[-i]
