Greedy

with regards to greedy vs DP approach:
    Whenever we see optimum or maximum or minimum or larget or smallest, the first approach which should strike our mind should be Greedy or 
    Dynamic Programming. If the problem is solvable via recursion, one should do for memoized recursion or DP else start with the brute 
    force and reduce it to Greedy.

greedy is an optimization solution. A greedy algorithm picks the best immediate choice and never reconsiders its choices.
You should use such solutions when it seems like there is an optimization trick that can produce the best result regardless if the input.
