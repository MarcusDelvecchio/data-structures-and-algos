DFS
BFS
union-find
    - number of connected components (in undirected)

topological sort
    - given a directed, acyclical graph
    - built on DFS

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algo
    - for *weighted* graphs
    - find the shortest path from a node and every other node in the  graph
    - uses a heap - constantly looking at the minimum of many dif edges
    - and hashset/hashmap to prevent cycles

Other
For minimum spanning trees:
    - Prim's algo
    - Kruskal's algo
 
Floyd Warshall's Algorithms
