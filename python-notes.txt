Python notes

python function parameters are pass by assignment (similar to pass by reference)
	- when you pass a variable into a function and change it's value, the inital variable will be changed (if it was pass-by-value, it would not, as only the variables *value* would be copied into the function)
	- however pass by assignment is different than pass by


In Python, everything is an object (like JS) and there are three primary characteristics (properties) of every object:
	- its id
	- it's  type
	- it's content'

	ex.

	>>> id(obj)
	2698212637504       # the identity of `obj`
	>>> type(obj)
	<class 'list'>      # the type of `obj`
	>>> obj
	[1, 2, 3]           # the contents of `obj`
