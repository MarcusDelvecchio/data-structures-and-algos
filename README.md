## A repository of notes, problems, and study material for data structures & algorithms

### Repository file structure:
```
/data-structures-and-algos

    /data-structure-x
        data-structure-x.py     <-- file with solutions relating to this specific data structure
        data-structure-x.txt    <-- file with notes relating to this specific data structure

    /problem-pattern-y
        problem-pattern-y.py    <-- file with solutions relating to this specific pattern or class of problem
        problem-pattern-y.txt   <-- file with notes relating to this specific pattern or class of problem
```
### 
Problems often pertain to **both** a certain core data structure and a certain pattern/problem class. Consequently, the problem can often be placed in more than one directory, so I decide which is more fitting based on the nature of the problem, or I add it to both.

### This repository contains ~400 solved LeetCode problems
