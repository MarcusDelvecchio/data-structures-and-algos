## A repository of notes, problems and study material for data structures & algorithms

### ~215 LeetCode Problems Solved see my profile [here](https://leetcode.com/MarcusDelVecchio/)

### repository file structure:
```
/data-structure-x
    data-structure-x.py     <-- python file containing solutions relating to this specific data structure
    data-structure-x.txt    <-- text file containing notes relating to this specific data structure
/problem-pattern-y.
    problem-pattern-y.py    <-- python file containing solutions relating to this specific pattern or class of problem
    problem-pattern-y.txt   <-- text file containing notes relating to this specific pattern or class of problem
```

Problems often pertain to **both** a certain core data structure and a certain pattern/problem class. Consequently, the problem can often be placed in more than one directory, so I decide which is more fitting based on the nature of the problem, or I add it to both.
