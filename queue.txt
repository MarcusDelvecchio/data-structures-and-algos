Queue (abstract data type) - FIFO
A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the 
sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence

"Front" vs "Back"
End of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements
are removed is called the head or front of the queue

operations
- adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue.
- other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it
