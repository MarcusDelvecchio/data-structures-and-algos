Monotonic stack:
A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or descreasing
(increasing or staying the same OR decreaseing or staying the same)

next greater element pattern:

say we have an array of integers and we want to convert each integers to their next greater element:
    - using a standard iterative approach, this would be an O(n^2) solution

we can use a monotonic stack to do this in O(n) because of the following (not necessarily intuitive) preoperty of the above problem:
    - say we have an array [3,2,7] and we are starting at 3, looking for its NGE
    - we traverse to 2, and see that it is not greater, so we continue to 7
    - we get to 7 and realize it is in fact, the next greater element for 3
    - however, we also know then, that *7 must also be the next greater element of 2 as well*
    - and this case would apply for any set of numbers between our current node and the node we are exploring to, as a means of finding the NGE

    but the following case would break this system:
    [3,1,2,4]
    in this case, the NGE of 3 â‰  the NGE of 1

    but using the monotonic stack this problem seems to be simply avoided?
