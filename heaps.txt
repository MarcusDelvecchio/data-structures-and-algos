Heap: (ak)
- A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P
  is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[1] The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.
- the "heap invariant" is that the root in ax max or min heap is the max or min (see invariants in dsa.txt file)

Heap questions are one of the most common questions frequently asked in interviews.

heaps vs priority queues:
- The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, 
- priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented
-   "Priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. 
    In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority"

binary heap:
- A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is an almost complete[2] binary tree
- is the data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm
- Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm


on children, parents, cousins:
- The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents, etc. The maximum number of children each 
  node can have depends on the type of heap.

on implementations:
- there are two kinda of heaps, max-heaps and min-heaps, where a nodes parent is greater than and less than itself respectively
- Heaps are typically constructed in-place in the same array where the elements are stored, with their structure being implicit in the 
  access pattern of the operations.
    - so it is a "tree based data structure" but is "are usually implemented with an array"
    - "each element in the array represents a node of the heap, and. The parent / child relationship is defined implicitly by the elements' indices in the array"
    - heap is an array where we visualize the nearly-complete binary tree -> no need to implement it with a tree, we can simply use an array
- Heaps differ in this way from other data structures with similar or in some cases better theoretic bounds such as Radix trees in that they 
  require no additional memory beyond that used for storing the keys

heaps aka "nearly complete binary trees" and binary heap
- all levels filled except lowest and lowest is partially filled, starting from the left

uses:
- heapsort (max-heap)
    - very very different than inertionsort and mergesort
- piority queues (piority-queues)

time complexity notes:
height of heap is BOUND by logn (sometimes you will see people saying the height is O(logn)) becuase it is a nearly complete binary tree, so the height always depends on n, in fact it is always logn


properties of heap as array: (*if the arrtay is 1 indexed - because it makes things eaiser*)
- root of the tree is always the firts element
- parent(i) = floor(i/2)
- left(i) = 2i 
- right(i) = 2i + 1 
left and right children^
- there are also max-heap and min-heap properties which we defined above (parent always greater than child and vice-versa for min)

- simple questions
    - checking if an array is a max or min heap: write a function that takes a heap and returns true if it has the max-heap property. And the same for min heap. (def is_max_heap() and is_min_heap())
    - building a max heap from an unsorted array:  wrtie a function that takes an array and build converts it to the max or min heap reprersentation (generate a max or min heap from said array) (which is in effect, sorting/changing the array to be ordered (not sorted order but max/min heap order))

        to build a max heap from an unsorted array, you recursively run a function max_heapify(arr). This function takes a heap, with the assumption that left(i) and right(i) are already max heaps (nodes below are already sorted) and contruct a final max heap with the provided root (depending on which of the root, the left or the right are the new max)
            - we then recusively perform this function going up the tree
            - max heapyify is O(logn) -> because of the assumption that left and right children are roots of max heaps themselves (and same for min heap and min-heapify)

        other notes:
        - in a nearly complete/complete binary tree A, nodes n/2 + 1 to n are all leaves
        - all leaves are automatically max-heaps (or min-heaps  )

on heaps and sorting from https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=B7hVxCmfPtM:
"
It makes perfect sense, because one of the simplest things that you want to do in a priority queue,
is you want to be able to create a priority queue, and you want to be able to run extract_max() on the priority queue, over and over.
And what that means, is that you take the max element, you delete it, take the next max element, delete it, and so on and so forth.
And there you go. It's a bit of a preview here, but you could imagine that if you did that, you would get a sorted list of elements in decreasing order.

So you see the connection to sorting, because you could imagine that once we have this heap structure, and we can maintain the max-heap property,
that we could continually run extract_max() on it. And if you could build extract max in an efficient way, you might have a fantastic sorting algorithm.

- questions:
    - if a heap is tree that is implemented as an array isn't traversal less efficient since nodes do not have a direct reference to their children as nodes do with a normal node-based tree implementation
    (for example if the heap was implemented as a node tree, each node would have a reference to its two child nodes)?
        answer: no. In a heap as array, a node's children are *implicit* (known) based on the order of the array and "traversing" back and forth in the array is just as fast as accessing a node's children in a tree - O(1). Remember that
        accessing any element in an array is O(1) - we do not need to "traverse" through the array until we get to that index. The valule at each index is stored and access directly from memory in O(1) time.


Usage: Understanding 4 patterns where HEAP data structure is used
    In python, the heapq module provides the basic features for Heap data structure.
    - minHeap are used in tasks related to scheduling or assignment. A more detailed explanation is under the Patterns section below.

        basic operations in Python heapq are:
        - heapify: this operation converts the iterable array heap into a tree structure w.r.t heap order.
        - heappush: inserts an element into the heap. Post insertion the heap order is adjusted to maintain the heap properties
        - heappop: This operation is to remove the element from the heap. By default it is minHeap, so this operation removes the min element from the minHeap. And for maxHeap, it is the maximum element. Post removal, heapify is called internally to maintain the heap order.

    Based on my understanding, different questions where HEAP is common data structure to use can be categorized in following 4 categories:

    1. Top K Pattern
    2. Merge K Sorted Pattern
    3. Two Heaps Pattern
    4. Minimum Number Pattern

Heap Operations: (all implemented at the top of heaps.py)

    Insert:
    - O(logn) worst case but O(1) average (as per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39514469/argument-for-o1-average-case-complexity-of-heap-insertion)
    1. Add the element to the bottom level of the heap at the leftmost open space.
    2. Compare the added element with its parent; if they are in the correct order, stop.
    3. If not, swap the element with its parent and return to the previous step.

    "Comparing and possibly swapping a node with its parent, are called the up-heap operation (also known as bubble-up, percolate-up, sift-up, trickle-up, swim-up, heapify-up, or cascade-up)."

    Extract:
    The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) while retaining the heap property is as follows:

    1. Replace the root of the heap with the last element on the last level.
    2. Compare the new root with its children; if they are in the correct order, stop.
    3. If not, swap the element with one of its children and return to the previous step. (Swap with its smaller child in a min-heap and its larger child in a max-heap.)

    Insert then extract:
    Inserting an element then extracting from the heap can be done more efficiently than simply calling the insert and extract functions 
    defined above, which would involve both an upheap and downheap operation. Instead, we can do just a downheap operation, as follows:

    1. Compare whether the item we're pushing or the peeked top of the heap is greater (assuming a max heap)
    2. If the root of the heap is greater:
        1. Replace the root with the new item
        2. Down-heapify starting from the root
    3. Else, return the item we're pushing

    (Python provides such a function for insertion then extraction called "heappushpop")

Heaps in Python and heapq
"import heapq"
- also note if you provide the heapq.heapify() function a list of tuples, it will always use the first value in each tuple as the key for the heap

# initializing list and using heapify to convert list into heap
li = [5, 7, 9, 1, 3]
heapq.heapify(li) # [1, 3, 9, 7, 5]

other functions:
heapq.heappush(li, 4)
heapq.heappop()
