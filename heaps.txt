Heap:
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P
is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[1] The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.
